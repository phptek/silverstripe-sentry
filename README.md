[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is an error and exception aggregation service. It takes your application's errors and stores them for later analysis and debugging. 

Imagine this: You see exceptions before your client does. This means the error > report > debug > patch > deploy cycle is the most efficient it can possibly be.

This module binds Sentry.io and locally-hosted Sentry installations, to the error & exception handler of SilverStripe. If you've used systems like 
[RayGun](https://raygun.com), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com), [AirBrake](https://airbrake.io/) and [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) before, you'll know roughly what to expect.

## Requirements

 * PHP5.4+
 * SilverStripe v3.1.0+ < 4.0

## Setup

Add the Composer package as a dependency to your project:

	composer require phptek/sentry: dev-master

Configure your application or site with the Sentry DSN into your project's YML config:

    phptek\Sentry\Adaptor\SentryClientAdaptor:
      opts:
        # Example DSN only. Obviously you'll need to setup your own Sentry "Project"
        dsn: http://deacdf9dfedb24ccdce1b90017b39dca:deacdf9dfedb24ccdce1b90017b39dca@sentry.mydomain.nz/44

## Usage

Sentry is normally setup once in your project's `_config.php` as follows, but see the [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for more detail and options.

    SS_Log::add_writer(\phptek\Sentry\SentryLogWriter::factory(), SS_Log::ERR, '<=');

## TODO

See the [TODO docs](docs/todo.md) for more.
